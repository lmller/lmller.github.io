I'm Lovis and I write Software.

I mostly work with Java and Kotlin and a lot of Android. JS (as in React) are also part of my portfolio now. You can find me in Hamburg, where I do Consulting, Coaching and Development at [codecentric](https://www.codecentric.de). 

A long time ago, I was also into game development with RPGMaker2000 (or not so long ago Unity3D). 

I have strong opinions on Agile &ndash;and software development practices in general.
I always try to uncover new ways of thinking and getting things done.  
That's also why I like and encourage never-ending discussions on how and why software development is fundamentally broken.

I'm also the organizer of the [Kotlin Usergroup Hamburg](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Kotlin-User-Group-Hamburg/)

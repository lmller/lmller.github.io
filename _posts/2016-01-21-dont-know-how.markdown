We as a field don't know what we are doing. We need to discover new ways of thinking. We need to get back to inventing things that matter.
 
Here are three videos that I recommend to everyone in the software industry:

- Bret Victor ["The Future of Programming"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4)
- Alan Kay ["The Computer Revolution hasn't happened yet"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY)
- Brad Frost [" I Have No Idea What the Hell I'm Doing!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A00mHGb8nvo)
 
Go watch them.

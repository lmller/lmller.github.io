### First law:
Every project will at one point in time discuss story slicing / feature releases without at least _trying_ to follow best practices

### Second law:
It’s inevitable that someone proposes 
- estimates,
- feature brachnes,
- late merges to master or
- all of the above

as a solution to that problem.

### Third law:
All projects are the same, yet all projects think they’re special
